1. Random Coin Flip Simulation:
- Use Python's random module to simulate a coin toss that results in either "Heads" or "Tails."
2. Multiple Tosses:
- Allow users to perform multiple coin flips in a single session. - Users can specify the number of flips they want to perform.
3. Count Results:
- Keep track of the total number of "Heads" and "Tails."
- Display the counts and percentages of each result at the end of the session.
4. Interactive User Input:
- Provide an easy-to-use interface where users can decide how many flips to simulate and whether torepeatthe session.
